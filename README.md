**CBORCoding** is a lightweight framework containing a coder pair for encoding and decoding `Codable` conforming types to and from [CBOR](https://cbor.io) document format for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS.

## Installation

**CBORCoding** is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) and the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/). 

To install via CocoaPods, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'CBORCoding'
```

To install via Carthage, simply add the following line to your Cartfile:

```ruby
github "SomeRandomiOSDev/CBORCoding"
```

To install via the Swift Package Manager add the following line to your `Package.swift` file's `dependencies`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/SomeRandomiOSDev/CBORCoding.git", from: "1.0.0")
```

## Usage

First import **CBORCoding** at the top of your Swift file:

```swift
import CBORCoding
```

After importing, the use is nearly identical to that of the `JSONEncoder`/`JSONDecoder` class pair provided by the Swift Foundation library. This example shows how to encode an instance of a simple `Car` type to a CBOR object: 

```swift
struct Car: Codable {
    var manufacturer: String
    var model: String
    var horsePower: Int
    var description: String?
}

let stinger = Car(manufacturer: "Kia", model: "Stinger GT2", horsePower: 365, description: nil)  
let encoder = CBOREncoder()

let encodedData = try encoder.encode(stinger)
print("CBOR: \(hexString(encodedData))")

/* Prints:
 CBOR: 0xA36C6D616E756661637475726572634B6961656D6F64656C6B5374696E676572204754326A686F727365506F77657219016D
*/
```

This example shows how to decode that encoded `Car` value at a later time: 

```swift
let decoder = CBORDecoder()
let stinger = try decoder.decode(Car.self, from: encodedData)
```

## 16-bit Floating Point Support

This package supports encoding/decoding Swift's `Float16` where available.  Unfortunately that does not include macOS on Intel processors, where an almost-identical type [`Half`](https://github.com/SomeRandomiOSDev/Half) is supported instead.

## CBOR

**Concise Binary Object Representation** is a data format for being able to encode formatted data with a goal of a having as small a message size as possible.

While this framework implements as much of the specification as possible, there are a few notable exceptions:

* CBOR supports keys of any defined type, however, since `Codable` relies on `CodingKey` for encoding/decoding its keyed containers, this framework is limited in its supported key types to `Int` and `String`.
* CBOR supports DecimalFractions and Bigfloats whose mantissa is a Bignum. With the current implementation, this is limited to Bignums whose content fits into either a `Int64` or `UInt64` type.

For more information about the CBOR format see: [CBOR](https://cbor.io) & [RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949).
